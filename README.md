# Beds-N-Brews: Project 1 ReadMe

## Overview

```
For Project 1, our team was asked to use the skills we have gained thus far at 
The Ohio State University Coding Boot Camp to build a web application from 
scratch. Our web application must integrate data received from multiple 
server-side API requests to solve a real-world problem.

## Solution

```

As the statistics above show, Americans love to travel. America’s hotels are filled with primarily 
domestic travelers who are there for leisure. We know that traveler's value where they stay and where 
they eat and drink because those are two of their top three expenses. Mobile search results show 
that US travelers prefer activities that are in proximity. Therefore, we have developed a 
web application that let’s travelers find hotels and brewery. This allows users to search hotels 
and breweries before deciding which city to travel to.  

Here is an explanation of how to use the Beds-N-Brews web application. 

The first step that a traveler needs to take when planning their next trip is to go to the 
Beds-N-Brews site. Next, enter a city that you are interested in visiting in the search 
bar. Then press the search button. Then scroll through the list of hotel and breweries. 
You are provided with a map of the hotels and the address of the breweries. If a brewery 
has a website, then a link to their company site is provided. You can use this information 
to find the best hotel and brewery combination for you.
